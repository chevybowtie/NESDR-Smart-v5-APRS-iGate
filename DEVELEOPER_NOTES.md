# Developer Notes

## Test Coverage
Run `.venv-1/bin/python -m pytest --cov` to execute the full test suite with coverage reporting.

## Docstring Guidelines
- Add and maintain Google-style docstrings for every function, method, and class (including helpers and nested functions).
- Document parameter types, return values, and error conditions to support contributors less familiar with Python conventions.
